This is my first day of starting a test repo. Starting a version controlled project i s best thing for developers. It's a must for working remotely and with great tech giants. few minutes earlier , I started with git, downloaded git on windows 10, openend command prompt of windows, created a folder, tunrned it into repo with git init.
Then I created a file the oldest way (copy con a.txt, ctrl+Z, with git bash easier: touch a.txt), and "git add ." . Then I commited it with   git commkit -m "my first repo, initialized". Then I moved to gitrHub website, logged in, from profile created this repo from within browser.
